# CS229-Final-Project
The "Data Processing" file accesses and cross references all the datasets mentioned in the report and outputs 2 CSV files:
data.csv - Columns are: "Sat Name"  "Days to Anomaly"  "Start of Observation"  "Sunspot Number"  "Flux of X-rays"  "Month of Observation"
satfeat.csv - Columns are "Sat Name"  "Perigee (km)"  "Inclination"  "Mass (kg)"

The naivebayes and svr files both apply their respective models to the data created from "Data Processing".
Make sure all three files are in the same repository before running.

NOTE: These files were made/run in Jupyter (data processing) and Spyder (other two)
